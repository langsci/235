\section{Current state and historical development}

\subsection{Iranian languages}

\ili{Iranian} languages, along with \ili{Indo-Aryan} and \ili{Nuristani} languages, constitute the group of Indo-\ili{Iranian} languages, which is a sizeable branch of the Indo-European language family. The term ``\ili{Iranian} language'' has historically been applied to any language that descended from a proto-\ili{Iranian} parent language spoken in \ili{Central} Asia in the late third to early second millennium BCE (\citealt{Skjærvø2012}).

\ili{Iranian} languages are known from three chronological stages: \ili{Old}, Middle, and New \ili{Iranian}. \ili{Persian} is the only language attested in all three historical stages. New \ili{Persian}, originally spoken in Fārs province, descended from Middle \ili{Persian}, the language of the Sasanian empire (third–seventh centuries CE), which is the progeny of \ili{Old} \ili{Persian}, the language of the Achaemenid empire (sixth–fourth centuries BCE). New \ili{Persian} is divided into Early \ili{Classical} (ninth–twelfth centuries CE), \ili{Classical} (thirteenth–nineteenth centuries) and Modern \ili{Persian} (from the nineteenth century onward), the latter considered to be based on the dialect of Tehran \citep[427]{Jeremiás2003}.

Today, \ili{Iranian} languages are spoken from the Caucasus, Turkey and Iraq in the west to Pakistan and Chinese Turkestan in the east, as well as in a large \isi{diaspora} in Europe and the Americas. New \ili{Iranian} languages are divided into two main groups: \ili{Western} and \ili{Eastern} \ili{Iranian} languages. The focus of this study is New \ili{Persian}, the most significant member among \ili{Iranian} languages, but a brief overview of \ili{Arabic} influence on other New \ili{Iranian} languages will also be provided. Below is a list of the most important members and their geographical distribution \citep[246]{Schmitt1989}.


\subsubsection{Western Iranian languages}



\subsubsubsection{Southwestern group}
\ili{Persian} (\textit{Fārsī}) (spoken throughout Iran and adjacent areas), \ili{Tajik} (the variety of New \ili{Persian} in \ili{Central} Asia), \ili{Darī} \ili{Persian} (Afghanistan), \ili{Kumzārī} (Musandam Peninsula). \ili{Persian} dialects in this group include \ili{Dizfūlī} (\ili{Khuzestan} province), \ili{Lurī} (ethnic group along the Zagros mountain range), \ili{Baḫtiārī} (nomadic tribe in the Zagros mountains), Fārs dialects (Fārs province), \ili{Lāristānī} dialects (Lāristān region of Fārs province), \ili{Bandarī} (dialects spoken around Bandar ʕAbbās in the \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf} region, to which \ili{Fīnī} also belongs).



\subsubsubsection{Northwestern group}
\ili{Kurdish}, \ili{Zazaki} (in eastern Turkey), \ili{Gurānī} (in eastern Iraq and western Iran), Balūčī (\ili{Balochi}, spoken chiefly in \ili{Iranian} and Pakistani Baluchistan, and parts of \ili{Oman}). Non-literary languages and dialects: \ili{Tātī}, \ili{Tālišī} and \ili{Gīlakī} (on the shores of the Caspian Sea), \ili{Central} dialects (spoken in a vast area between Hamadān, Kāšān and Iṣfahān), \ili{Kirmānī} (south of the Dašt-i Kawīr).

\subsection{Historical development of Arabic–Persian language contact} %1.2. /

Language contact between \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Persian} has been a \isi{reciprocal} process for the past 1500 years. During the pre-Islamic and early Islamic era (sixth–seventh centuries CE), Middle \ili{Persian}, being embedded in the well-established and sophisticated \ili{Iranian} culture, provided many \isi{loanwords} to pre-\ili{Classical} and \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt{Gazsi2011}: 1015; see also van Putten, this volume)\ia{van Putten, Marijn@van Putten, Marijn} under \isi{RL} (\isi{recipient-language}) agentivity (\citealt{VanCoetsem1988,VanCoetsem2000}). With the collapse of the Sasanian Empire and expansion of Islam and the \ili{Arabic} language over vast territories outside Arabia, \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} began to exercise an unprecedented impact on the emerging New \ili{Persian} language. \ili{Arabic} never took \isi{root} in the everyday communication of the ethnically \ili{Persian} population, although it gained some dominance as a written vehicle in the administrative, theological, literary and scientific domains in the eastern periphery of the Abbasid Caliphate. Instead, spoken Middle \ili{Persian} (\textit{Darī}) flourished as a vernacular language. In the middle of the ninth century CE, it was in this part of Iran, specifically in Fārs province, that \textit{Darī} emerged in a new form as it repositioned itself in the culture and literature of the local populace. This new literary language, the revitalization of the \ili{Persian} linguistic heritage, would be called New \ili{Persian}. Since its earliest phase, New \ili{Persian} has borrowed a staggering number of \isi{loanwords}. Initially, these \isi{loanwords} were borrowed from various northwestern and eastern \ili{Iranian} languages, such as \ili{Parthian} and \ili{Sogdian}. Despite this relatively large group of loans, the most versatile lenders were the Arabs. Whereas in the pre-Islamic era \ili{Arabic} had almost exclusively taken lexical items from Middle \ili{Persian} (in the fields of religion, botany, science and bureaucracy among others), New \ili{Persian} also incorporated \ili{Arabic} morphosyntactic elements.

The first \ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords} began to permeate New \ili{Persian} in the ninth–tenth centuries CE (20–30\%). This process was not even diminished by the \ili{Iranian} \textit{šuʕūbiyya} movement, the major output of which was all conducted in \ili{Arabic}. In subsequent centuries, \ili{Persian} continued to absorb an ever-expanding set of \ili{Arabic} lexemes. By the turn of the twelfth century, the proportion of \ili{Arabic} loans increased to approximately 50\%. The majority of \ili{Arabic} loans had already been integrated into New \ili{Persian} by that time and have shown a remarkable steadiness until recently.

After the fall of Baghdad in 1258 CE, \ili{Arabic} lost its foothold in the eastern provinces of the Caliphate, thereby drawing the final boundary between the use of \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Persian} \citep{Danner2000}. The Mongol Ilkhānids, who as non-\isi{Muslims} were not dependent on \ili{Arabic}, introduced \ili{Persian} as the language of education and administration in Iran and \isi{Anatolia}. Despite the significant destruction the Mongols caused to northern Iran during their conquest, this period (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE) is considered to be the zenith of \ili{Persian} literature. This is also the epoch when literary \ili{Persian} is, in an excessive way, inundated with \ili{Arabic} language elements. This phenomenon is easily detectable in the works of one of the most significant personalities in \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} literature, and a pre-eminent poet of thirteenth-century Persia, Saʕdī of Shiraz. Following the norms of \ili{Persian} prose writing and poetry of his time, Saʕdī flooded his writings with a bewildering array of \ili{Arabic} language elements. To illustrate this, here is a typical sentence from Saʕdī’s \textit{Gulistān} ‘Rose Garden’ (completed in 1258 CE), where words of \ili{Arabic} origin are highlighted in boldface (\citealt{Yūsifī2004}: 77).

\z

It is easy to ascertain that, apart from verbs and adverbs, almost every lexical item in the sentence is of \ili{Arabic} origin. But writers of this era, such as Saʕdī, not only inundated their works with \ili{Arabic} elements, but even used \ili{Arabic} morphology and semantics freely by coining new and innovative meanings, e.g. \textit{ṣaʕqa} ‘lightning’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṣāʕiqa} or \textit{baṭṭāl} ‘liar’ < MSA/MSP ‘inactive, unemployed person’,\footnote{In the chapter, references are made to \ili{Modern Standard} \ili{Arabic} (MSA) and \ili{Modern Standard} \ili{Persian} (MSP) as a comparison to dialectal forms in both languages. This seemed more straightforward as it is not always feasible to ascertain at what point in time a lexeme was borrowed from \ili{Arabic} into \ili{Persian}.} < MSA \textit{mubṭil} ‘liar’. The \ili{Persian} and \ili{Arabic} language use of Saʕdī and other literary figures in the \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} period came closest to what \citet{Lucas2015} calls \isi{convergence} under the language dominance principle. As reflected in the purely \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Arabic}-infused \ili{Persian} segments of his oeuvre, Saʕdī was equally dominant in both \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} along with the dialect of Shiraz.

Modern \ili{Persian} is still deeply rooted in \ili{Arabic}. \ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords} constitute more than 50\% of its vocabulary, but in elevated styles (religious, scientific, literary) \ili{Arabic} loans may exceed 80\% \citep{Jeremiás2011}. Although the proportion of these \isi{loanwords} fluctuates according to age, genre, social context or idiolect, any style in Modern \ili{Persian} deprived of \ili{Arabic} influence is almost impossible. An endeavor similar to \iai{Atatürk}’s to purge \ili{Turkish} of foreign language elements would be unrealistic in Modern \ili{Persian}, even with recurring efforts by linguistic purists and the Academy of \ili{Persian} Language and Literature (\textit{Farhangistān-i} \textit{zabān} \textit{wa} \textit{adab-i} \textit{fārsī}).\footnote{An example of their activity is the publication (by \citealt{Rāzī2004}) of a dictionary that lists “pure” \ili{Persian} words.} It is noteworthy that when the need arose for new terminology to describe fledgling political concepts in Iran, for instance during the Constitutional Revolution in the early twentieth\textsuperscript{} century, as \citet{Elwell-Sutton2000} phrased it, “politicians and journalists instinctively turned to \ili{Arabic} rather than \ili{Persian}”. Frequently, however, these “\ili{Arabic}” words were new coinages in the \isi{recipient language}, e.g. \textit{mašrūṭa} ‘constitution’, \textit{mawqiʕiyyat} ‘situation, position’. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979, another wave of \ili{Arabic} lexemes related to the new religious governing system surfaced, e.g. \textit{mustaẓʕifīn} ‘the needy, the enfeebled’ (< MSA \textit{mustaḍʕafūna}\kern 0.5pt/\kern -1pt\textit{mustaḍʕafīna}).

Primary and secondary schools in contemporary \ili{Arabic}-speaking countries do not offer language education in \ili{Persian}. In Iran, compulsory \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} instruction is part of the curriculum. However, the language is taught for religious purposes only, with no intention to utilize MSA as a means of acquiring communication skills.

\section{Contact languages}

This section briefly describes the linguistic impact of \ili{Standard} \ili{Arabic} on several New \ili{Iranian} languages. A more detailed analysis of contact-induced \isi{language change} in New \ili{Persian} (\textit{Fārsī}) will follow in §\ref{dial}.

\subsection{Arabic influence on New Iranian languages}

\subsubsection{Tajik (\textit{Tōǧīkī})}

\ili{Tajik}, written in a modified Cyrillic script, is the variety of New \ili{Persian} spoken throughout \ili{Central} Asia, most notably in Tajikistan, \ili{Uzbekistan}, and northern Afghanistan. Similarly to all varieties of \ili{Persian}, \ili{Arabic} borrowings constitute the earliest layer of foreign vocabulary in \ili{Tajik} \citep{Perry2009}. This lexicon was transferred under \isi{RL} agentivity. Although \ili{Arabic} lexical items have a firm hold in \ili{Tajik}, their pattern of distribution differs from that of New \ili{Persian}. For instance, \ili{Tajik} uses \textit{pēš} ‘before’ and \textit{pas} ‘after’ rather than MSA/MSP \textit{qabl} and \textit{baʕd}, but \textit{ōid} \textit{ba}{}-/\textit{ōid-i} (< MSA \textit{ʕāʔid} ‘returning’) ‘concerning, relating to’ in lieu of MSP \textit{rāǧiʕ} \textit{ba}{}- (< MSA \textit{rāǧiʕ} ‘recurring’). Also, \textit{madaniyyat} ‘civilization’ (< MSA \textit{madaniyya} ‘civilization’; cf. MSA/MSP \textit{tamaddun} ‘civilization’), \textit{hōzir} ‘now’ (< MSA \textit{ḥāḍir} ‘present; ready’, MSP \textit{ḥāẓir} ‘present’), \textit{ittifōq} ‘(labor) union’ (< MSA \textit{ittifāq} ‘\isi{agreement}; contract’; cf.  MSP \textit{ittiḥād} ‘[labor] union’).

\ili{Arabic} plural forms, both sound feminine plural and \isi{broken plural}, were lexicalized with \isi{collective} or singular meanings: \textit{hašarōt} ‘insect’, with regular plural ending \textit{hašarōthō} ‘insects’ (< MSA/MSP \textit{ḥašarāt} ‘insects’), \textit{talaba} ‘student’, pl. \textit{talabagōn} (< MSA/MSP \textit{ṭalaba} ‘students’), \textit{šarōit} ‘condition, stipulation’ (< MSA/MSP \textit{šarāʔiṭ} ‘conditions’).


\subsubsection{Kurdish}

A characteristic feature of \ili{Kurdish}, the change of postvocalic /m/ > /v/ or /w/, also occurs frequently in words of \ili{Arabic} origin: \textit{silāv} ‘greeting’ (< MSA/MSP \textit{salām}; \citealt{Paul2008}).

\subsubsection{Gurānī}

The phonological system of \ili{Gurānī} dialects is similar to \ili{Kurdish} in the occurrence of \ili{Arabic} \isi{pharyngeal} and \isi{emphatic} sounds /ʕ/, /ḥ/, /ṣ/ \citep{MacKenzie2012}.

\subsubsection{Ossetic}
\ili{Ossetic} has incorporated terms related to Islam from \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Persian} through neighboring Caucasian languages \citep{Thordarson2009}.

\subsection{Arabic-speaking communities in Iran}
\ili{Arabic}-speaking communities are known to be present within the boundaries of the Islamic Republic of Iran, but their exact number is not readily discernible from official statistics. It is estimated that 3\% of Iran’s 80 million citizens are Arabs, which would put the Arab population at approximately 2.5 million. The majority of Arabs live in the western parts of \ili{Khuzestan} province (see Leitner, this volume),\ia{Leitner, Bettina@Leitner, Bettina} but also along Iran’s \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf} coast and parts of Khorasan in eastern Iran \citep{Oberling2011}. Already during the Sasanian era, several Arab tribes, including the Bakr ibn Wāʔil and Banū Tamīm, settled in the area stretching from the Šaṭṭ al-ʕArab to the Zagros Mountains \citep{Daniel2011}. At the end of the sixteenth century, the Banū Kaʕb, originating from present-day Kuwait, settled in \ili{Khuzestan}. During subsequent centuries, more Arab tribes moved from southern Iraq to the province. As a result, \ili{Khuzestan}, which until 1925 was called ʕArabistān, became extensively Arabized. Members of these Arab tribes live on either side of the Iran–Iraq border. In the same way as \ili{Iraqi} \ili{Arabic} vernaculars, \ili{Khuzestan} \ili{Arabic} has been influenced by \ili{Persian}. However, \ili{Khuzestan} \ili{Arabic} can most easily be distinguished from \ili{Iraqi} dialects by its wide-ranging \isi{transfer} of \ili{Persian} lexemes (\citealt{Ingham1997}: 25; see also Leitner, this volume).\ia{Leitner, Bettina@Leitner, Bettina}

Arab presence has a well-documented history on the \ili{Iranian} coastline of the \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf}, in what now constitutes Būšihr and Hurmuzgān provinces. According to travelogues from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries CE, as well as \ili{British} archival materials dating back to the \ili{British} Residency of the \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf}, Arab tribes inhabited most fishing and pearling villages, as well as islands and coastal towns with strategic importance (e.g. Bandar ʕAbbās). The most significant tribes in this area were, and in some cases still are, the Qawāsim, Marāzīq, Āl Ḥaram, Āl ʕAlī, Āl Naṣūr, Banī Tamīm, Banī Ḥammād, Banī Bišr, among others. In contrast to most Persians and Khuzestani Arabs who are primarily Shiite, these tribes are Sunni \isi{Muslims}. A widespread exonym to designate Arabs on the \ili{Iranian} coast, but shunned by the local population, is \textit{hōla} (variously referred to as \textit{hula}, \textit{huwala} or \textit{hawala}). Local tribes prefer the endonym ‘Arabs of the Coast’ (\textit{ʕarab} \textit{as-sāḥil}) \citep[110]{Gazsi2017}.

Most Khuzestani and \ili{Iranian} \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf} Arabs are bilingual, speaking \ili{Arabic} as their mother tongue and \ili{Persian} as a second language. Although \ili{Khuzestan} and the two \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf} provinces are geographically part of Iran, linguistically their Arab populations form a continuum with the southern \ili{Mesopotamian} Muslim \textit{gilit}{} dialects, and the dialects of the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, respectively. In the spoken and written code, ‘Arabs of the Coast’ often engage in tetra-glossic switching between MSA, \ili{Gulf} \ili{Arabic} (GA), MSP, Colloquial \ili{Persian} and one of its local dialects such as \ili{Bandarī}. In their speech, \ili{Persian} phonological and lexical elements are borrowed into GA under \isi{RL} agentivity.

\section{Contact-induced changes in New Persian and modern Persian dialects} \label{dial}
Language contact between \ili{Arabic} and New \ili{Persian} is most evidently detectable in the New \ili{Persian} lexicon, and to a lesser extent in phonology and morphosyntax. This section summarizes the characteristics of this contact. In addition to standard New \ili{Persian}, and its contemporary variant MSP, \ili{Arabic} has also influenced modern \ili{Persian} dialects. This influence is slightly different, and in several ways more far-reaching, particularly in the realm of phonology and lexicon.

\ili{Persian} dialects developed separately from and parallel to \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} and MSP. Modern \ili{Persian} dialects retain several Early \ili{Classical} and \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} phonological and morphosyntactic features that are not present in MSP. Additionally, they were in direct contact with the \ili{Arabic} language through Arab tribes that settled across Persia immediately after the Islamic conquest or in later centuries. Although most Arab tribes have long been integrated into the \ili{Persian}-speaking population, the \ili{Arabic} language in the areas currently dominated by ethnic Arabs is still in contact with the surrounding \ili{Persian} dialects. Unlike \ili{Arabic} influence on the standard version of New \ili{Persian}, \ili{Arabic} influence on modern \ili{Persian} dialects is an understudied field that does not allow for providing an exhaustive list of contact-induced changes at this point. Instead, below is a preliminary description of salient examples of how \ili{Arabic} phonological and lexical elements were transferred to New \ili{Persian}, both its standard and dialectal variations.

\subsection{Phonology}


\subsubsection{New Persian}

The initial step in the adoption of \ili{Arabic} lexemes was the adoption of the \ili{Arabic} script. New \ili{Persian} began to use a modified \ili{Arabic} script in the ninth century CE; it has 32 letters, 28 taken over from \ili{Arabic} and 4 new letters added to represent \ili{Persian} phonemes (/p/, /č/, /ž/, /g/). \ili{Arabic} /θ/ and /ṣ/ collapse to \ili{Persian} /s/, \ili{Arabic} /ð/, /ḍ/, /ð̣/ collapse to \ili{Persian} /z/, and \ili{Arabic} /ṭ/ becomes \ili{Persian} /t/. The phonemic inventory of Early \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} was augmented with the glottal stop, which originated in the two separate \ili{Arabic} phonemes /ʔ/ and /ʕ/.

\subsubsection{Modern Persian dialects}

This section highlights phonological features of modern \ili{Persian} dialects that were the result of contact-induced \isi{language change} under \isi{RL} agentivity, either with \ili{Arabic} or with \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} and subsequently MSP.

\subsubsubsection{Adoption of Arabic pharyngeal sounds}

The two \ili{Arabic} \isi{pharyngeal} sounds undergo phonological integration in New \ili{Persian}: the voiceless \isi{pharyngeal} fricative /ḥ/ is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative /h/, and the voiced \isi{pharyngeal} fricative /ʕ/ as a glottal stop /ʔ/. The dialects of Dizfūl and Šūštar have acquired \isi{pharyngeal} sounds directly from \ili{Arabic}, which occur in \ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords}: \textit{ʕaǧīb} ‘strange’, \textit{baʕd} ‘after’ \citep{MacKinnon2015}. The dialect of Jarkūya shares this feature: \textit{ḥasüd} ‘jealous’, \textit{ǧimʕa} ‘Friday’ \citep{Borjian2008}.

The dialect of Kulāb in Tajikistan also borrows \ili{Arabic} \isi{pharyngeal} sounds in words of \ili{Arabic} origin: \textit{ʕaib} ‘flaw’, \textit{daʕvō} ‘claim’, \textit{mıʕalim} ‘teacher’, \textit{ḥıkımat} ‘wisdom’, \textit{sōḥib} ‘owner’. \ili{Arabic} \isi{pharyngeal} sounds also occur in a few \ili{Persian}/Tajiki words (\textit{ʕasp} ‘horse’, \textit{ḥamsōya} ‘neighbor’). Interestingly, the \isi{pharyngealized} form for ‘horse’ occurs far and wide within the \ili{Iranian} linguistic domain, as \textit{ʕasb} in the \ili{Lurī} dialect of Šūštar, in \ili{Ḫānsāri} and Caucasian \ili{Tātī}. In the Arab \ili{Gulf} states, the \textit{ʕAǧam}, ethnic Persians holding Kuwaiti, Emirati and other \ili{Gulf} citizenship, pronounce \ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords} in their \ili{Persian} speech with \isi{pharyngeal} sounds.

\subsubsubsection{Dropping of Arabic pharyngeal sounds}

In several modern \ili{Persian} dialects, the voiceless \isi{pharyngeal} fricative /ḥ/ is absent. The preceding vowel is lengthened or the subsequent vowel disappears too, e.g. \textit{mūtāǧ} ‘in need, destitute’ < MSA/MSP \textit{muḥtāǧ} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 190), \textit{ṣārā} ‘desert’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṣaḥrā} \citep[15]{Sarlak2002}, \textit{ṣāb} ‘owner’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṣāḥib} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 135), \textit{mulāẓa} ‘consideration, observation’ < MSP \textit{mulāḥiẓa}, cf. MSA \textit{mulāḥað̣a} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 188), \textit{ṣul} ‘peace’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṣulḥ} \citep{Stilo2001}, \textit{ēsās} ‘feeling’ < MSA/MSP \textit{iḥsās} (\citealt{Salāmī2004}: 160–161). In Kirmān, the sound change /uḥ/ > /ā/ is attested, e.g. \textit{fāš} ‘insult’ < MSA/MSP \textit{fuḥš} \citep{Borjian2017}.

    The voiced \isi{pharyngeal} fricative /ʕ/, pronounced as a glottal stop in MSP, can also be dropped. This may result in vowel lengthening: \textit{māṭal} ‘idle’ < MSA/MSP \textit{muʕaṭṭal} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 184), \textit{māmila} ‘transaction’ < NewP \textit{muʕāmila}, cf. MSA \textit{muʕāmala} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 184; \citealt{Sarlak2002}: 15), \textit{rubbi} \textit{sāt} ‘quarter hour’ < MSP \textit{rubʕ} \textit{sāʕat}, cf. MSA \textit{rubʕ} \textit{sāʕa} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 108), \textit{mānī} ‘meaning’ < MSP \textit{maʕnī}, cf. MSA \textit{maʕnā} \citep[15]{Sarlak2002}, \textit{mōǧiza} ‘miracle’ < MSA/MSP \textit{muʕǧiza} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 190), \textit{tāǧub} \~{} \textit{tāǧuv} ‘surprise, wonder’ < MSA/MSP \textit{taʕaǧǧub} (\citealt{Salāmī2004}: 162–163), \textit{rāyat} ‘regard’ < MSP \textit{riʕāyat}, cf. MSA \textit{riʕāya} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 107).

\subsubsubsection{Dropping of the Arabic voiceless glottal fricative /h/}

The voiceless glottal fricative disappears in closed syllables in many \ili{Persian} dialects, resulting in occasional vowel lengthening: \textit{ṭārat} ‘cleanliness’ < MSP \textit{ṭahārat}, cf. MSA \textit{ṭahāra} \citep[76]{Sarlak2002}, \textit{nāal} ‘impolite’ < MSP \textit{nāahl} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 192).

\subsubsubsection{Miscellaneous sound changes}

A range of additional consonant developments and shifts can be attested in \ili{Persian} dialects. Some of these developments include:

\begin{itemize}
\item[]
/ʕ/ > /ḥ/: In \ili{Lurī} and the dialect of Jarkūya, a shift occurs from the voiced to the voiceless \isi{pharyngeal}: \textit{ḥilāǧ} ‘cure’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ʕilāǧ} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 207), \textit{ṭaḥna} ‘sarcasm’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṭaʕna} \citep{Borjian2008}.

\item[]
/ḥ/ > /ʔ/ occurring with occasional metathesis: \textit{ṭaʔr} ‘plan’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ṭarḥ} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 137), \textit{maʔla} ‘city quarter’ < MSA/MSP \textit{maḥalla} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 188), \textit{maʔala} ‘city quarter’ (\citealt{NaǧībiFīni2002}: 133).

\item[]
/h/ > /ʔ/: \textit{muʔlat} ‘deadline, respite’ < MSP \textit{muhlat}, cf. MSA \textit{muhla} (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 190).

\item[]
/θ/ > /t/: This shift is also common in several \ili{Arabic} dialects, e.g. in Egypt and Morocco: \textit{mīrāt} ‘heritage’ < MSP \textit{mīrās}, cf. MSA \textit{mīrāθ} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 190).

\item[]
Word-final /b/ and /f/ > /m/: \textit{naǧīm} ‘noble’ < MSA/MSP \textit{naǧīb} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 193), \textit{niṣm} ‘half’ < MSA/MSP \textit{niṣf} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 195).

\item[]
/r/ > /l/: in Kirmān, \textit{zilar} \~{} \textit{zilal} ‘damage, loss’ < MSP \textit{ẓarar}, cf.

The full /t/ of the \textit{tāʔ} \textit{marbūṭa} appears on words where it is absent in MSP: \textit{ḥalmat} ‘attack’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ḥamla} (\citealt{Īzadpanāh2001}: 207), \textit{ḥaǧāmat} ‘cupping’ < MSA/MSP \textit{ḥaǧāma} (\citealt{Salāmī2004}: 92–93). This was a typical feature of \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} literature.

\subsection{Morphosyntax}

Several \ili{Arabic} morphosyntactic features were transferred to New \ili{Persian} in the realm of nominal morphology under \isi{RL} agentivity. These features encompass sound and \isi{broken plural} forms (\textit{musāfirīn} ‘passengers’, \textit{tablīɣāt} ‘propaganda’, \textit{dihāt} ‘villages’, \textit{ḥuqūq} ‘rights’), possessive constructions (\textit{fāriɣ} \textit{ut-taḥṣīl} ‘graduate’, \textit{wāǧib} \textit{ul-iǧrā} ‘peremptory’) and occasional \isi{gender} \isi{agreement} in lexicalized expressions (\textit{quwwa-yi} \textit{darrāka} ‘perceptive power’). Word \isi{formation} has been an active method of transferring \ili{Arabic} lexical elements into New \ili{Persian} from early on, either by way of \isi{derivation} (\textit{diḫālat} ‘interference’ < MSA \textit{mudāḫala}, \textit{awlā-tar} ‘superior’ < MSA \textit{awlā}, \textit{raqṣīdan} ‘to dance’ < MSA \textit{raqṣ}, \textit{aks̱aran} ‘most, generally’ < MSA \textit{akθar} ‘more, most’) or compounding. Compounding is a highly developed process of enlarging the New \ili{Persian} vocabulary. It is manifest in lexical \isi{compounds} (\textit{taɣẕia-šinās} ‘nutritionist’, \textit{ḫiānat-kārāna} ‘perfidiously’) and phrasal \isi{compounds} (\textit{iṭāʕat} \textit{kardan} ‘to obey’, \textit{ʕadam-i} \textit{wuǧūd} ‘non-existence’, \textit{ʕala} \textit{l-ḫuṣūṣ} ‘particularly’).

\subsection{Lexicon}

\subsubsection{Arabic lexicon in New Persian}

Contact-induced \isi{language change} manifests itself most strikingly in the lexicon transferred from \ili{Arabic} to New \ili{Persian} under \isi{RL} agentivity. The earliest \isi{loanwords} entered New \ili{Persian} during the ninth–tenth centuries. This process occurred smoothly, as the phonological inventory of Early \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian} was likely close to that of Middle \ili{Persian} and also close to that of \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic}.\footnote{In Early \ili{Classical} \ili{Persian}, short vowels were likely pronounced as /u/ and /i/, and the \textit{alif} as /ā/. In MSP, the pronunciation is /o/, /e/ and /ɒ/.} The influx of \ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords} has unabatedly continued over the centuries until now. To showcase a recent example of \ili{Arabic} vocabulary in Modern \ili{Persian}, below are titles of articles from \textit{Hamšahrī} ‘fellow citizen’, a major \ili{Iranian} national newspaper, taken from its 29th January 2018 edition. \ili{Arabic} words are highlighted in boldface:

\ea
\ea
\gll \textbf{kulliyyāt}-i \textbf{lāyiḥa}-yi būdǧa-yi sāl-i 97-i \textbf{kull}-i kišwar \textbf{radd} šud\\

    \glt ‘The total budget bill of the year 2018 for the whole country was rejected.’

    \glt ‘Calling the residents of Tehran to donate blood. Names of active centers.’

    \glt‘Personal authentication in real estate transactions is done with the national smart card.’

In the \ili{Arabic} lexicon of New \ili{Persian}, further characteristics can be observed, such as phonetic changes (NewP \textit{maʔnī} ‘meaning’ < MSA \textit{maʕnā}, NewP \textit{madrisa} ‘school’ < MSA \textit{madrasa}, NewP \textit{šikl} ‘shape, form’ < SA \textit{šakl}), where in some cases the \ili{Persian} pronunciation may follow \ili{Arabic} dialectal forms, semantic changes (NewP \textit{kitābat} ‘writing’ and \textit{kitāba} ‘inscription’ < MSA \textit{kitāba} ‘writing’, NewP \textit{ṣuḥbat} ‘speech’ < MSA \textit{ṣuḥba} ‘companionship’), and occasional \textit{imāla} in elevated or poetic style (NewP \textit{ḥiǧīz} < MSA \textit{ḥiǧāz}).

\subsubsection{Arabic lexicon in Persian dialects}

\ili{Arabic} \isi{loanwords} affect \ili{Persian} dialects in two ways that differ from MSP: i) semantic changes, where \ili{Arabic} lexemes assume new meanings unattested in both MSA and MSP: in Kirmān \textit{ðāt} ‘age’   (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 106) < MSA/MSP ‘self, soul, essence, nature’, \textit{ðātī} ‘old’ < MSA/MSP ‘own, personal’; ii) lexemes and expressions directly borrowed from \ili{Arabic}, and not attested in MSP: in Šūštar, \textit{ḥaya} ‘snake’ < MSA \textit{ḥayya}, MSP \textit{mār} (\citealt{Fāẓilī2004}: 140), \textit{ṭayyāra} ‘airplane’ < \ili{Arabic} dialects \textit{ṭayyāra}, MSA \textit{ṭāʔira}, MSP \textit{hawāpaimā} (\citealt{Fāẓilī2004}: 150), \textit{ṣaḥn} ‘bowl, dish’ < MSA \textit{ṣaḥn}, MSP \textit{bušqāb} (\citealt{Fāẓilī2004}: 150), \textit{ṭabaq} ‘plate, tray’ < MSA \textit{ṭabaq}, MSP \textit{sīnī} (\citealt{Fāẓilī2004}: 150), in Fīn, \textit{mismāl} ‘nail’ < MSA \textit{mismār}, MSP \textit{mīḫ} ‘nail’ (\citealt{NaǧībiFīni2002}: 133), in Kirmān, \textit{aḥad} \textit{un-nās} ‘nobody, somebody’ < MSA \textit{aḥad} \textit{un-nās}, MSP \textit{hīčkas} ‘nobody’, \textit{kasī} ‘somebody’ (\citealt{Ṣarrāfī1996}: 33).

On the \ili{Persian} \ili{Gulf} coast of Iran, due to linguistic, economic and commercial connections with the Arabian Peninsula, \ili{Persian} dialects have incorporated a number of \ili{Arabic} technical terms relating to pearling, fishing and traditional shipbuilding from \ili{Gulf} \ili{Arabic}: \textit{muḥār} ‘shellfish, oysters’ (cf. MSA \textit{maḥār}), \textit{giyās} ‘measure, gauge’ (< GA \textit{giyās}, cf. MSA \textit{qiyās}), \textit{mīdāf} ‘helm (boat)’ (< GA \textit{mīdāf}, cf. MSA \textit{miǧdāf}), \textit{māčila} ‘meal (on a boat)’ (< GA \textit{māčila}, cf. MSA \textit{maʔkūl}). Two neighborhoods in the town of Bandar Linga (opposite Dubai, 180 km west of Bandar ʕAbbās) are called \textit{Maḥalla-yi} \textit{Baḥrainī} ‘\ili{Bahraini} Quarter’ and \textit{Maḥalla-yi} \textit{Sammāčī} ‘Fishers’ Quarter’ (< GA \textit{sammāč}, cf. MSA \textit{sammāk}) (\citealt{Baḫtiyārī1990}: 137–138).

\section{Conclusion}

Although \ili{Arabic}–\ili{Persian} language contact has been a well-known phenomenon for centuries, academic research dedicated to this topic is far from abundant. Throughout the centuries, \ili{Persian} writers and poets used \ili{Arabic} lexical elements in new meanings or coined non-standard Perso-\ili{Arabic} lexemes based on \ili{Arabic} \isi{derivational} patterns. Idiosyncratic features of individual \ili{Persian} writers should be examined separately before compiling a comprehensive review of this contact-induced \isi{language change}. Substantial fieldwork needs to be conducted to describe the \isi{bilingualism} of ethnic Arab communities of Iran and ethnic Persians in \ili{Arabic}-speaking countries. Additionally, it is essential for linguists to look into \ili{Arabic} influence on Modern \ili{Persian} dialects and \ili{Iranian} languages other than New \ili{Persian}. This will help scholars understand the scale and depth of how \ili{Arabic} has shaped \ili{Iranian} languages for the past thousand years.

Contact-induced \isi{language change} in New \ili{Iranian} languages primarily transpired under \isi{RL} agentivity. It should be noted, however, that medieval \ili{Persian} literati were so well-versed in \ili{Arabic} due to its \isi{prestige} and dominance, that their \isi{bilingualism} may have enabled \isi{convergence} in \ili{Arabic}–\ili{Persian} language contact.
